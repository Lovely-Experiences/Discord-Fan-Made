# Discord-Fan-Made

This is a fan made version of Discord, with way less features of course. This is still being created, and may not function or work correctly. If you would like to contribute, don't hesitate to make a pull request or issue!

The reason behind this project is to attempt at making something well maintained and organized. While also learning stuff along the way! This project is more of just something to have fun and mess around with. However, the code behind this project is taken seriously and the security measures are too.

Thanks, Jacob Humston
